this is fragment . to return multiple component we use them, it binds them together
as in react we can only return one compo at a time.

import React from 'react';
const page=()=>{
    var x="jay"
    return (
     <>
     <h1>hello {x}</h1>
     <h2>How are you </h2>
     </>
     )
}
export default page
