import React from 'react'
import Link from "next/link"
const page = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href='/About'>About</Link>
      <Link href='/Courses'>Courses</Link>
    </div>
  )
}

export default page


you can also use a tag but that will cause reloadig

--> in routing we load new page , so in every new page there should be page.js a first file like index.js
//here About folder and course have page.js too
