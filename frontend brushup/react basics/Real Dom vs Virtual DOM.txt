->DOM stands for document object model

->in html every thing is considered as DOM tree
like window -> html -> body -> div 
                               /  \
                            #ele1 #ele2

-> In real dom even if we change an element , it updates/refersh complete dom tree
-> in virtual dom , it creates multiple copies , and if there is change in original and copy it will update only that part.
 so in virtual dom complete page dosent render , just a component renders
